# haskript-tfd
Independent FFI wrapper for [tinyfiledialogs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/) to Haskell.

Multi-platform file dialogs and basic GUI functionality.

**Beep** / **Input Box** / **Message Box** / **Alert** / **Save File** / **Open File** / **Select Directory** / **Color Chooser**

Wrapper intended as an alternative to mtolly's [tinyfiledialogs](https://github.com/mtolly/tinyfiledialogs) using more up-to-date libs.

Warning: some functions are not sanitized or only block inputs, as in the original library.
